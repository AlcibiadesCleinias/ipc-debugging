# Hardhat Boilerplate with Typescripted Contracts 

This repository contains a sample project that you can use as the starting point
for your Ethereum project. It's also a great fit for learning the basics of
smart contract development.

This project is intended to be used with the
[Hardhat Beginners Tutorial](https://hardhat.org/tutorial), but you should be
able to follow it by yourself by reading the README and exploring its
`contracts`, `tests`, `scripts`, `tasks`, and `frontend` directories.

# Feature

This repository uses our recommended hardhat setup, by using our [`@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox`](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/plugins/nomicfoundation-hardhat-toolbox). When you use this plugin, you'll be able to:

- Deploy and interact with your contracts using [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/) and the [`hardhat-ethers`](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/plugins/nomiclabs-hardhat-ethers) plugin.
- Test your contracts with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/), [Chai](https://chaijs.com/) and our own [Hardhat Chai Matchers](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-chai-matchers) plugin.
- Interact with Hardhat Network with our [Hardhat Network Helpers](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network-helpers).
- Verify the source code of your contracts with the [hardhat-etherscan](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/plugins/nomiclabs-hardhat-etherscan) plugin.
- Get metrics on the gas used by your contracts with the [hardhat-gas-reporter](https://github.com/cgewecke/hardhat-gas-reporter) plugin.
- Measure your tests coverage with [solidity-coverage](https://github.com/sc-forks/solidity-coverage).

This project also includes [a sample frontend/Dapp](./frontend), which uses [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Additional Feature
Additionally, to the basic **Hardhat Boilerplate** features mentioned above.

- [x] support env - thus, you could perform contract manipulation on different chains under different addresses via related **env** settings (check [.example.env](.example.env))
- [x] support TS - thus, your frontend could use the typechain-types of the contracts, scripts.
- [x] npm package & deploy pkg ci - thus, you could scale your team work without missing concentration on contract development: merely push to the main branch. It uses public registry. Additional settings must be provided in [hardhat-boilerplate-with-typescripted-contracts-artifacts/package.json](packages/hardhat-boilerplate-with-typescripted-contracts-artifacts/package.json) with your naming.  
- [x] add ci tests - thus, you show that you are concern about workable contract developments.
- [x] demo TokenContractClient - thus, you as a "backend" developer prepare client API class for the frontend
(api client class with accurate prepared methods, not raw contract calls).
- [x] Install [hardhat-deploy](https://github.com/wighawag/hardhat-deploy) and use, - thus you no needs in deploy scripts, you could store usable contract JSON ABI artifacts with deployed address in a proven manner.
- [ ] migrate to pnpm - thus, you spend less time and work with last upd of npm.


### Typechain-types for Contracts
When typechain-types integrated into Hardhat it allows you to use this types in hardhat scripts the next pattern:

```typescript
// E.g. inside scripts/deploy.ts.
import {Token} from "../typechain-types";
const token = await Token.deploy() as Token;
```

**Warn of Hardhat tasks and typechain-types**

> When you run Hardhat scripts, e.g. `npx hardhat run scripts`, you allow hardhat runtime to firstly compile 
typechain types of your contracts and then run your scripts, but for a Hardhat tasks it is not the same. 

Hereby, it is highly recommended running `npx hardhat run typechain` before running the Hardhat task.

# Frontend Integration
TL;DR

Suppose that the actual frontend needs to be used via NPM package (e.g. public registry.npmjs.org),
and even with help of predefined special backend-for-frontend class 
(e.g. [TokenContractClient.ts](frontend-clients/TokenContractClient.ts))

But for some cases, e.g. hackathons, it will be faster and simple to debug with local frontend app 
(i.e. in the same repo) with typechain-types and contract address file injection, e.g. [example frontend](frontend), 
where typechain-types and contract address is injected via Hardhat tasks and scripts. 

Both variants of the usage will be discussed below.

## In-Frontend Artifacts Injection
**in progress...** TODO: make workable typescript example instead of deprecated js: [frontend](frontend).

## Package Integration

Repo structured with npm sub-repo exactly for artifacts those frontend (frontend team) may want to use in order to 
work with contracts.

For additional info check 
[artifacts package/README.md](packages/hardhat-boilerplate-with-typescripted-contracts-artifacts/README.md).

# Quick start

The first things you need to do are cloning this repository and installing its
dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat-boilerplate.git
cd hardhat-boilerplate
npm install
```

In the repo demonstration Hardhat scripts and tasks preserved. 
Below is ste-by-step flow about the iteratction with the features. 

Once installed, let's run Hardhat's testing network:

```sh
npx hardhat node
```

Then, on a new terminal, go to the repository's root folder and run this to
deploy your contract:

```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network localhost
```

To check that hardhat task, [faucet.ts](tasks/faucet.ts), will transfer 1 eth 
to provided address from **already deployed** contract, run the next command:

```sh
 npx hardhat faucet 0x795a04d0F74e892c452bB45747dFFdcDA286FBE7 --network localhost
```

Finally, we can run the frontend with:

```sh
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see your Dapp. You will
need to have [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet) or [Metamask](https://metamask.io) installed and listening to
`localhost 8545`.

# User Guide

You can find detailed instructions on using this repository and many tips in [its documentation](https://hardhat.org/tutorial).

# Troubleshooting

- `Invalid nonce` errors: if you are seeing this error on the `npx hardhat node`
  console, try resetting your Metamask account. This will reset the account's
  transaction history and also the nonce. Open Metamask, click on your account
  followed by `Settings > Advanced > Clear activity tab data`.

# Setting up your editor

[Hardhat for Visual Studio Code](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-vscode) is the official Hardhat extension that adds advanced support for Solidity to VSCode. If you use Visual Studio Code, give it a try!
